# Trajectories 
Use PUCT MCTS to find trajectories through a busy road. Road state can be modeled 
with a vq-vae representation. An example implementation is found in: 
[roadway_vqvae.py](https://github.com/rllabmcgill/MCTS_function_approximation/blob/master/trajectories/examples/roadway_vqvae.py)

Repo with latest code can be found in:

An example of our MCTS agent performing on level 6 of the roadway environment using vq-vae to represent the roadway state with the rollouts shown.
