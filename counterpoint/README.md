# Counterpoint
Use PUCT MCTS to find harmony according to a cantus firmus. 

Rules and environment based on the book "The Study of Counterpoint", from Johann Joseph Fux's "Gradus Ad Parnassum", translated by Alfred Mann.

See trace_0.wav for an example rendering, using Timidity. All .mid and .ly files are included in saved_*

For viewing .ly files, in Linux lilypond is usually used, the pdf output can be created using `lilypond file.ly`. .mid files require a midi player, in Linux timidity is a common choice. After installing timidity, the audio can be heard using `timidity file.mid`.

To run the code (tested in Python 2.7), do `python three_voice_pucts_mcts.py`. This will begin running the planning algorithm against each cantus firmus from the set of species 1 examples from the book.
